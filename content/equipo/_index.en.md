      bio: "Since I first started working as a software engineer, I have always aspired to improve my skills and support my colleagues advance their careers. In an effort to make my love for assisting others into a full-time career, I joined the Software Craftsmanship community in 2017 and registered as a Software Crafter at Codurance. Today, I dedicate 100% of my time to help teams deliver high quality software, by coaching Extreme programming practices and Software craftsmanship values along with my own team at Exeal.",

      bio: "I first owned a computer when I was nine years old, and ever since then, something inside of me has been changed by technology and computers. Years later, I started repairing computers, which allowed me to launch my own sales and repair business for a short while. I felt more and more certain that this was the appropriate course of action as each year went by. My first opportunity to create software came after my first years of college studying software engineering. Since that time, I have continued to study and develop in this fantastic world. Today I am dedicated to training teams to achieve their maximum performance 游눩 both from a technical and methodological point of view. I hope to see you soon! 游녦",

      bio: "When I was ten years old, a schoolteacher exposed me to the world of programming, and I immediately became captivated with computer science (with Turbo Pascal). From that moment on, I knew what I wanted to do, so I ended up studying computer science at the Rovira i Virgili University in Tarragona. After ten years of working as a professional software developer, I realized that something wasn't quite right and that there had to be a better way of doing things. Since then, I focused my efforts on learning these other ways, and I spent several years working in an environment with a strong eXtreme Programming culture. I now attempt to teach others everything I have learned, both technical and soft skills.",

      bio: "I firmly believe that words can change the world, just as I believe that communication is water and we decide whether to drink it or die of thirst. Short tales, novels, poems, and essays were all around me growing up. When I had the option of choosing what to study, I opted for a career in journalism and social media, which in addition to journalism itself, included learning about marketing and advertising. And now that I work in the IT industry, I want to emphasize the value of strong communication practices there as well as the necessity of \"deploying\" them with the best possible procedures. If we want to find solutions to certain problems in such a varied and diverse market, we will have to get to know each other. So, le'ts do it!",

      bio: "For your loved ones, being an obsessive control freak and organizer might be stressful, but in my case, at least from a professional one, it has been my biggest asset.  Although I initially studied music (yes, I am a flautist), one of my great hobbies has always been \"organising\". From the home's filing cabinets, any form of paper, a party, or a significant vacation. Studying for a degree in tourism and training in international secretarial work was like a hobby for me. When I was working with the now-defunct Transhotel Travel Agency in 2003, I was approached to take part in an intriguing project involving a GDS (global booking engine), which would be completely user-friendly for the general public unlike its predecessors Savia Amadeus or Sabre. A few years later, very few would need a tourism professional to organise their holidays. It was time for a change of industry, but I was already totally hooked on UX design. Over the last fifteen years I have been able to expand my training in digital marketing, product management, web programming and e-commerce. At Exeal, as Office Manager, I am able to indulge my \"organisational hobby\" with a highly motivated and creative team.",
